        The overall look is meant to give a feeling of “pen on paper”.
Blue ink text colour, very discreet.
Paper background, very discreet too.
Readable line length, around three alphabets — the classical rule says “around two and a half alphabet, not more than three and a half ”.
The text column stays centred in the window. When the window is narrow, it stays clear of the border, whatever the zoom level.
Links and footnote markers are discreet, but conspicuous. They are highlighted when hovered by the pointer.
Headers level 1 and 2 get a typographic rule, so they stand out.
It’s generally advised to use H1 as the document title and nowhere else in the document. Thus, it has a very minimal space above it in order to spare space at the top of the document.
Header 3 is meant as a subtitle. It’s clearly distinct from body text, but spares vertical space. Useful to introduce parts of a note.
Lists — both bulleted and numbered — are rather compact, but nevertheless visually breathing and logically grouped, even many levels deep.
Elegant, decorative ornament for HR (horizontal rule).
Tables :
centred horizontally ;
text in heading row aligns to the bottom of the cells ;
text in the rows aligns to the top of the cells ;
alternating row pattern ;
title is distinctive, but not overwhelming (smaller than H#) ;
NB : it’s a bug of the DEVONthink’s rendering engine that puts the table title always below the table, regardless of what is specified in the CSS. Personally, I would rather have the title above the table.
Images :
framed with a thin line ;
limited to column width ;
when in “portrait mode” (i.e. taller than wide), they are vertically limited in order to preserve the proportions with the text and not fill the screen !
left aligned ;
the caption is visually grouped with the image.
