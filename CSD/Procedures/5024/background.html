## "Prewarming" a query2 machine

- A consequence of the design decisions; query2 has long initial delays when requesting a table.
- If a table has not been requested within the last 20 minutes:
    - Once requested, it may take up to 5 minutes before the table becomes available on an aggregator.
- To help avoid long delays when requesting a table for the first time, we can invalidate the above by permanently requesting specific tables or **"Prewarming"**.
