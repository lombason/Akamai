Most External Requests for Velvet Rope changes will have an associated Salesforce Capacity Request (commonly referred to as a “CapReq”, ID will resemble “F-CPR-99999”) that is provided in the request.

1. The following scenarios **require** an associated Salesforce Capacity Request, which should be referenced in the External Request ticket:
 
+ Request to permanently increase a bucket's load limit (excluding shadow buckets)
+ Request to temporarily increase a bucket's load limit due to an event (excluding shadow buckets)

    1. If there is no Salesforce Capacity Request referenced in the ticket, ask the requester to provide one as per the [Capacity Request Guidelines](https://ac.akamai.com/docs/DOC-90173). 
    1. If the External Request does reference a capacity request:
        + Find the associated Capacity Request in [SalesForce](https://akamai.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O4R0000087w45UAA/view) and confirm it is approved. 
            * If it has been rejected, do not proceed with the request. 
            * If the request is event-related and has not been approved/rejected yet, and has been opened with CSD due to the event starting in < 24 hours, consider this an emergency event request and follow [Emergency Event Requests](#emergency)
        + In the CapReq, look for the section named “Approval Details”
        + If the CapReq references geo-specific CP Codes, create geo-specific VR buckets based on the approved limits. 
        + If the CapReq DOES NOT reference geo-specific CP Codes, create a global VR bucket with the aggregate limits. 
        + If the CapReq is geo-specific (ie: the limit requested and approved in a single geo), create a geo-specific VR bucket.
    1. Proceed to [Verify the Change](#checks).
