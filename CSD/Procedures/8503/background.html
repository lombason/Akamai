<h3>The VelvetRope system,</strong> using defined rules, monitors traffic load per cpcode</h3>

<ul><li>The <a href="<a href="/sme/?g_id=151>Akamai Capacity Team</a> keeps track of the overall network capacity and of traffic for each customer/event for each Akamai network.</li>
<li><strong>Escalations should be directed to the appropriate SME lists. </strong></li>

<li>'Shadow Buckets' in Velvet Rope are used to group high volume customers and share overflow space</li>

<li> External requests are automatically rerouted to CSD_TRIAGE_QUEUE come into the NOCC_ASSIGN_QUEUE, and are then triaged by the CSD team.</li>

<li> Most External Requests for Velvet Rope changes will have an associated Salesforce Capacity Request, commonly referred to as a â€œCapReq</li>
<ul><li>ID provided in the request will resemble: <code>F-CPR-99999</code></ul>
<li>The following procedure is for CSD to follow when receiving a request to make changes to the VR configuration <code>[MappingCenter.1.VelvetRope.BucketLimit]</code> </li>
